# Pharmaceutical-Drug-Recognition
Identify the Pharmaceutical Drug used from the given images
Issuing of correct prescriptions is the mainstay of patient safety. Medication errors are the most important problem that influences safety in health care . The most common medication errors are caused by human factors, such as fatigue and inadequate knowledge. In particular, look-alike and sound-alike (LASA) is the lead error at the level of pharmacists or physicians.

 

A good policy to prevent LASA is to change drug names and their packaging. Researchers used chart reviews and mathematical methods to identify problematic pairs of drug names, and constructed an automated detection system to detect and prevent LASA errors. Unfortunately, major problems remain in drug identification: many drugs look alike; drugs are relatively small in size; and a large number of drugs need to be identified. Existing identification solutions still have their limitations 

 

Alternatively, image-based solutions have been developed. Most significantly, thanks to the vigorous development of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for parallel computing, a current mainstream process is to adopt deep learning methods to replace traditional classifiers.

 

Objective

 

Your Task is to come up with a Deep Learning Algorithm that helps the doctors to successfully classify the pharmaceutical drugs thereby reducing any unnecessary mishaps.
